#Class Manager

This app is a test of the has_many :through association method in rails. For this example, someone who manages classes can use this app to enroll students to different classrooms.

##Use

Students can be added to the app by going to the Students directory. Once a student has been added, the user can then create a classroom and add a student to by going to the Classrooms directory.

A student's individual page lists the classes that they are enrolled in; as well, each class also shows with students are enrolled in it.
